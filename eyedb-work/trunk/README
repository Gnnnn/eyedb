1) Adding a new topic

bash scripts/newtopic TOPIC

This will create the following files and directories:
src/TOPIC
src/TOPIC/ChangeLog
src/TOPIC/Makefile.am

The src/TOPIC/Makefile.am is copied from scripts/newtopic/template/Makefile.am

The 'newtopic' script updates the following files:
ChangeLog
configure.in
src/Makefile.am


2) Updating the topic directory

Edit src/TOPIC/Makefile.am to add:
- the list of binaries to build
- for each list of binaries, the list of C++ sources
- the list of Java files
- the ODL file (currently only one file allowed)
- the scripts

The generated Makefile.am contains rules to create shell scripts. To create
a shell script:
- create a SCRIPTNAME.sh.in file
- add SCRIPTNAME to TOPIC_SCRIPT_FILES

The SCRIPTNAME.sh.in file can contain variables like:
EYEDB_BINDIR=@EYEDB_BINDIR@
$EYEDB_BINDIR/eyedbdbcreate foo

The @@ variables will be automatically substituted when running make


3) Generating the Makefiles

In top directory, run:
./autogen.sh
./configure

As configure must know the path to eyedb.pc (the EyeDB pkg-config file), 
you must pass PKG_CONFIG_PATH to configure, for instance with:
PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$HOME/projects/eyedb_install/lib/pkgconfig ./configure 

configure supports also standard definitions, for instance:
PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$HOME/projects/eyedb_install/lib/pkgconfig ./configure CXX=gcc-4.1 JAVAC=/usr/local/java/jdk1.5.0_05/bin/javac JAVA=/usr/local/java/jdk1.5.0_05/bin/java


4) Compile

Compile with:
make

at toplevel directory or in topic subdirectory
